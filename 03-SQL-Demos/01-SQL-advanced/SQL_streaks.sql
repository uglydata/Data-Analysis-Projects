/*

General Algorithm Steps for Streak Calculation
1. Base CTE:
	Select necessary columns.
	Use LAG() to look at previous rowâ€™s value.
	Define a break flag (1 = streak break, 0 = continue streak) based on your condition.

2. Streak ID CTE:
	Use SUM(break_flag) OVER (ORDER BY id/season) to assign a streak ID for each group of continuous rows.
	Streak Analysis CTE (optional):
	Calculate count of rows per streak (COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY streak_id)).
	Calculate aggregations (min, max, etc.) if needed.

3. Final Selection:
	Filter to keep only streaks that meet your minimum length (e.g., at least 3 or 10 rows).

	Variants
	RowID/Delta Method:
	When IDs are perfectly sequential, use id - ROW_NUMBER() trick to create streaks by constant delta.
	
	Sliding Window Method:
	Instead of cumulative sums, use a moving window (ROWS BETWEEN n PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) to check conditions across limited rows.
