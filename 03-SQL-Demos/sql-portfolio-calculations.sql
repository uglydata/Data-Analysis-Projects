-- PART 1

-- SQL DEMO: Comparing Multiple Approaches to Year-End Portfolio Value Calculation

-- GOAL: Retrieve stock portfolio value at the end of each year using different SQL techniques.

-- TECHNIQUES DEMONSTRATED (6 Approaches):
-- 1. Window Functions (`RANK()`, `LAST_VALUE()`)
-- 2Ô∏è. Subqueries (Correlated & Non-Correlated)
-- 3Ô∏è. Optimized Combinations (`DISTINCT ON`, `ROW_NUMBER()`)

-- PERFORMANCE COMPARISON:
-- - Some methods are **fast & efficient**, others are **simpler but slower**.
-- - Each approach highlights **key trade-offs** between speed, readability, and complexity.

-- DEPENDENCY:
-- - Data processed using: 
--  üîó `https://github.com/uglydata/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/01-Stock-Portfolio-Data-Processing-Dashboards/3_stocks_portfolio_processing.sql`
-- - Results stored in: `temp_portfelis_` (PostgreSQL table)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Option 1

-- porftolio data -simulate powerbi, with CTE, last value - inefficient sql, see different sql
-- Evaluation: inefficient, NOT RECOMMENDED ‚Äì Full window scan makes this slow.
-- Execution time: 1.251sec

Query calculates monthly portfolio values using timeseries data.
Tables Used: calendar, stock_and_dividends, portfolio_info

Approach:
	Excludes duplicates from stock prices.
	Retrieves monthly closing prices using window functions.
	Computes portfolio values and dividends for each stock.
	Uses CTEs, window functions, and LEFT JOINs to align stock data with portfolio holdings.
